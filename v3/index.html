                When you eat chicken, does it feel pointy or round? Is a week shaped like a tipped-over D with the days
                arranged counterclockwise? Does the note B taste like horseradish? Do you get confused about
                appointments because Tuesday and Thursday have the same color? Do you go to the wrong train station in
                New York City because 'Grand Central' has the same color as the 42nd Street address of 'Penn Station'?
                When you read a newspaper or listen to someone speaking do you see a rainbow of colors?
                <br><br>
                If so, you might have synesthesia.

                Cases of Synesthesia
            </h1>
            <p class="pp montserrat-body">
                Synesthesia is an anomalous blending of the senses in which the stimulation of one modality
                simultaneously produces sensation in a different modality. Synesthetes hear colors, feel sounds and
                taste shapes. What makes synesthesia different from drug-induced hallucinations is that synesthetic
                sensations are highly consistent: for particular synesthetes, the note F is always a reddish shade of
                rust, a 3 is always pink or <span class="blue-text">truck</span> is always blue.

                Grapheme-Color Synesthesia
            </h1>
            <p class="pp montserrat-body">
                The estimated occurrence of synesthesia ranges from rarer than one in 20,000 to as
                prevalent as one in 200. Of the various manifestations of synesthesia, the most common involves seeing
                monochromatic letters, digits and words in unique colors – this is called <em>grapheme-color
                    synesthesia</em>.
                One rather striking observation is that such synesthetes all seem to experience very different colors
                for the
                same graphemic cues. Different synesthetes may see 3 in yellow, pink or red. Such synesthetic colors are
                not
                elicited by meaning, because 2 may be orange but two is blue and 7 may be red but seven is green. Even
                more
                perplexing is that synesthetes typically report seeing both the color the character is printed in as
                well as
                their synesthetic color. For example, the letter is both blue (real color) and light green (synesthetic color).

                Advantages of Synesthesia
            </h1>
            <p class="pp montserrat-body">
                Synesthetes report having unusually good memory for things such as phone numbers,security codes and
                polysyllabic anatomical terminology because digits, letters and syllables take on such a unique panoply
                of colors. But synesthetes also report making computational errors because 6 and 8 have the same color
                and claim to prejudge couples they meet because the colors of their first names clash so hideously.
                <br><br>
                For too long, synesthetes were dismissed as having overactive imaginations,
                confusing memories for perceptions, or taking metaphorical speech far too literally.
                <br><br>
                Recent research, however, has documented the reality of synesthesia and is
                beginning to make headway into understanding what might cause such unusual perceptions.
                Research has documented that synesthetic colors are perceived in much the same way that nonsynesthetic
                individuals perceive real colors. Thus, synesthetic color differences can facilitate performance on
                tasks in
                which real color differences facilitate performance for nonsynesthetes and can impair performance on
                tasks in
                which real color differences impair performance for nonsynesthetes.
                <br><br>
                In one such task, people are asked to say the color of the ink a word is printed
                in as quickly as possible (for example, responding "pink" to the word blue, printed in pink, and "blue"
                to the
                word pink, printed in blue). For lexical synesthetes, these words take on unique colors. When the
                synesthetic
                color matches the ink color, responses are fast. But when the synesthetic color mismatches the ink
                color,
                responses are slow, presumably because subjects need to resolve the conflict over which color name to
                respond
                with. Although such results demonstrate that synesthesia is automatic, in the sense that they cannot
                turn off
                their synesthesic experience even when it interferes with a task, these results do not reveal whether
                synesthetic colors are perceptions or memories.
                <br><br>
                To demonstrate the perceptual reality of synesthetic colors, researchers have
                introduced synesthetic color differences into a variety of traditional visual-perception tasks.
                Searching for a
                6 among 9s is a difficult task because the digits are so visually similar, differing by only a mirror
                reflection. If the 6 was colored orange and the 9s were colored green, the search task would be
                trivially easy
                because the orange digit visually pops out from the background of green digits. When shown a display
                consisting
                of monochromatic digits, we found that a synesthete could quickly find the target because for him 6 was
                orange
                but 9 was green.

                The Neural Mechanism
            </h1>
            <p class="pp montserrat-body">
                Vilayanur Ramachandran and Edward M. Hubbard of the University of California at San Diego, have reported complementary findings supporting the perceptual reality of synesthetic colors.
                In one task, they presented synesthetes with an array of equally-spaced letters and digits. Synesthetes
                reported that these arrays organized themselves into distinct rows or columns depending on whether the rows or columns of characters were the same synesthetic color. This perceptual grouping based on synesthetic color is analogous to the kind of perceptual grouping non-synesthetes experience with real colors.
                <br><br>
                Claims for the perceptual reality of synesthetic colors have been bolstered by recent functional brain imaging studies by researchers in the U. K. showing that synesthetic color
                activates central visual areas of the brain thought to be involved in perceiving real colors.
                <br><br>
                The neural mechanism by which synesthetic colors are automatically bound to alphanumeric characters remains a mystery. One possibility is that synesthesia might arise from some kind of anomalous cross-wiring between brain areas that are normally segregated in nonsynesthetic individuals.
                For grapheme-color synesthesia, there may be cross-wiring between digit and letter processing areas and color processing areas in the visual cortex, which occupy neighboring regions of the human brain.

                Conclusion
            </h1>
            <p class="pp montserrat-body">
                The causes of synesthesia also remain unknown. Some scientists have suggested that
                everyone is born synesthetic but that the typical developmental trajectory results in these highly
                interconnected brain areas becoming far more segregated. We do not know why synesthetes retain some of these
                anomalous connections. A biological determinant may be partially at work in certain cases of synesthesia,
                because the condition tends to run in families; moreover, nearly six times as many women as men report
                synesthesia. Whatever its etiology, synesthesia provides cognitive neuroscientists with a unique opportunity to
                learn more about how the brain creates our perceptual reality.
